In today's competitive automotive industry, tracking and analyzing sales performance is crucial for sustainable growth. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI to empower the car dealership with data-driven decision-making. The dashboard provides real-time 
    insights into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to car sales, enabling the company to monitor sales trends, identify growth opportunities, and optimize business operations.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a dynamic Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes critical metrics related to sales, average prices, cars sold, and geographical distribution. This provides stakeholders with actionable insights to drive business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

## Scope of the Project
The Car Sales Dashboard covers the following key aspects:
   1. Sales Overview – Year-to-date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales performance, including Year-over-Year (YOY) growth and comparisons with previous years.
   2. Average Price Analysis – Evaluating the average sale price across periods and measuring growth.
   3. Cars Sold Metrics – Tracking the number of cars sold and comparing it with previous periods.
   4. Geographical and Demographic Insights – Analyzing car sales by dealer region, body style, and color.
